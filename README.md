Small projects and examples

hoverZoom: includes a project where I wanted to center a div with a solid border inside another div. 
The outer div has a image background that zooms in whenever the mouse hovers over any of the outer or inner divs.

carousel: implemented from vanilla javascript. No transition when changing images
