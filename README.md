Small projects and examples

# hoverZoom
includes a project where I wanted to center a div with a solid border inside another div. 
The outer div has a image background that zooms in whenever the mouse hovers over any of the outer or inner divs

# carousel
implemented from vanilla javascript. No transition when changing images

# simple_javascript_form
form with 4 input textfields: name, email, password and pas# sword confirmation

# products
shows three photos that change with smooth transition to another photo when hovered by the mouse pointer. Also, when hovered, a "contact me" tab rises from the bottom of the photo.
